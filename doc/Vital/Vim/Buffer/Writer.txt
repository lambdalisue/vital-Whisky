INTRODUCTION				*Vital.Vim.Buffer.Writer-introduction*

*Vital.Vim.Buffer.Writer* is a module to write buffer contents.
It is mainly used for gradually write mass contents to the buffer without
interrupting user's actions.


=============================================================================
INTERFACE				*Vital.Vim.Buffer.Writer-interface*

			*Vital.Vim.Buffer.Writer.replace()*
replace({expr}, {start}, {end}, {replacement})
	Replace contents between {start} to {end} of a {expr} buffer with
	a given {replacement} (|List|).

	Indexing of {start} and {end} is zero-based and end-exclusive.
	Additionally the negative indices are counts from the last, mean that
	the -1 indicate the last line.

	For example
>
	call Writer.replace('%', 0, 0, ['Hello'])
	" Insert 'Hello' line at the top of the buffer

	call Writer.replace('%', -1, -1, ['World'])
	" Append 'World' line at the bottom of the buffer

	call Writer.replace('%', -2, -1, ['Darkness'])
	" Replace the last 'World' line to 'Darkness'

	call Writer.replace('%', 0, -1, [])
	" Remove entire contents
<
	Note that it uses |iconv()| function to convert {replacement} from
	'encoding' to 'fileencoding' of the {expr} buffer. However, it uses
	{replacement} as-is when
	
	1. 'fileencoding' of the {expr} buffer is empty
	2. 'encoding' and 'fileencoding' of the {expr} buffer is equal
	3. |iconv()| completely failed to convert {replacement}

	Note that this method works even the {expr} buffer is
	specified as 'nomodifiable' buffer. It temporary off that option and
	restore.

	Note that using this method may temporary change a current buffer
	in Vim. However it does not affects the followings

	1. Content of non target buffer
	2. cursor position
	3. |alternate-file|
	4. |jumplist||

	But it would affects the followings (the behavior has not defined or
	tested yet.)

	1. |undolist||

	Note that this method does not work and return 1 when

	1. The {expr} buffer does not exist
	2. Vim is going to close (|VimLeave| has emitted)
	3. |v:dying| is not 0 (Vim is forcedly closing)

			*Vital.Vim.Buffer.Writer.new()*
new([{options}])
	Create a new writer instance.
	The following options are available on {options}.

	"bufnr"		A target buffer number.
			Default is a current buffer number.

	"updatetime"	An interval milliseconds between each flush.
			Default is |Vital.Vim.Buffer.Writer.updatetime|.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTANCE				*Vital.Vim.Buffer.Writer-instance*

				*Vital.Vim.Buffer.Writer-instance.start()*
{writer}.start()
	Start an internal timer of the {writer}.
	The internaly timer periodically call "flush()" method of the
	{writer} to update the target buffer contents.

	It kill existing writer instances which have an equal target buffer.

	It calls "on_start()" callback of the {writer} if the callback
	exists on the instance.

	Note that it does nothing when the {writer} has already started.

				*Vital.Vim.Buffer.Writer-instance.stop()*
{writer}.stop()
	Stop an internal timer of the {writer} on next tick so that the
	last empty line can be removed (See "write()" for the detail.)
	Use "kill()" method to immediately stop the timer.

				*Vital.Vim.Buffer.Writer-instance.kill()*
{writer}.kill()
	Stop an internal timer of the {writer} immediately.
	
	It will be called automatically when "stop()" method has called in
	previous tick.

	It calls "on_exit()" callback of the {writer} if the callback
	exists on the instance.

				*Vital.Vim.Buffer.Writer-instance.write()*
{writer}.write({content})
	Write {content} to an internal buffer of the {writer}.

	The {content} must follow the POSIX text format, mean that the
	complete {content} always ends with an empty line. For example
>
	call writer.start()
	call writer.write(['Hello', 'World', ''])
	call writer.write(['Hello', ''])
	call writer.write(['World', ''])
	call writer.write(['Hello', 'Wor'])
	call writer.write(['ld', ''])
	sleep 1m
	" > Hello
	" > World
	" > Hello
	" > World
	" > Hello
	" > World
	" >
<
	Note that the last empty line will be removed in the final tick when
	"stop()" method is used and the writer successfully terminate.
>
	" ... continues from above example
	call writer.stop()
	sleep 1m
	" > Hello
	" > World
	" > Hello
	" > World
	" > Hello
	" > World
<
				*Vital.Vim.Buffer.Writer-instance.flush()*
{writer}.flush()
	Manually flush an internal buffer to the target buffer.
	It is automatically called by an internal timer when the {writer}
	has started so usually user do not need to call it manually.
